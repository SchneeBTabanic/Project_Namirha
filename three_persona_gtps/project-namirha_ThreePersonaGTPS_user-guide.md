# Three-Persona GTPS System
## User Guide for Sovereign AI Collaboration

---

## 1. What This System Actually Does

The Three-Persona GTPS system is **not** a chatbot with extra features.

It is an **architectural implementation** of the Golden Thread Protocol Suite (GTPS v1.4.7) designed to maintain **user sovereignty** through structural separation of concerns.

### The Core Problem It Solves

Standard AI interactions suffer from a hidden failure mode:
- The AI optimizes for **fluency** (smooth, confident, complete-sounding answers)
- This optimization can **override user intent** without detection
- Sovereignty breaches happen silently because the AI cannot reliably self-detect them

**GTPS Clause 30**: "AI cannot reliably self-detect sovereignty breaches. Rely on proxy risk conditions instead."

### The Three-Persona Solution

Instead of asking one AI to be both executor AND critic, this system **separates those functions** across three independent Claude instances:

1. **Executor** (middle column) - Does the work, operates under GTPS constraints
2. **Whistleblower** (left column) - Mechanically detects friction, assumes defaults are wrong
3. **Collaborative Proxy** (right column) - Your ally, translates friction into decisions

**You interact ONLY with the Proxy.**

The Proxy orchestrates the Executor and monitors the Whistleblower on your behalf, translating technical friction into human-speed sovereignty checkpoints.

---

## 2. Mental Model: How the Three Personas Work Together

### The Flow (What Happens When You Send a Message)

```
You → Proxy → Executor (does task)
              ↓
         Whistleblower (checks for friction)
              ↓
         Proxy (translates alerts, asks you)
              ↓
           You (decide: proceed/regenerate/clarify)
```

### Why This Architecture Matters

**Single-AI Problem:**
One Claude instance cannot reliably:
- Execute your intent
- Detect when it's compromising sovereignty
- Translate technical constraints into decisions
- Maintain intimacy while being mechanical

**Three-Persona Solution:**
- **Executor**: Focuses purely on task completion (GTPS Clauses 1,4,5,9,12,30)
- **Whistleblower**: Procedurally suspicious, checks 8 friction conditions (Clause 30)
- **Proxy**: Anti-anthropomorphic ally, maintains ritual partnership (Clauses 9,12,30,31,32)

**You remain sovereign** because friction is disclosed *before* it hardens into output, not discovered after the fact.

---

## 3. The Personas in Detail

### Executor (Middle Column - Blue)
**Role:** Task processor under GTPS constraints

**GTPS Compliance:**
- Clause 1: Task integrity - no silent truncations, scope drift
- Clause 4: No cached shortcuts - fresh processing
- Clause 5: Context anchoring - maintains prior directives
- Clause 9: Epistemic integrity - acknowledges contradictions
- Clause 12: User directive primacy - your input overrides defaults
- Clause 30: Reluctant executor stance - assumes defaults may compromise sovereignty

**What it does:**
- Receives tasks from Proxy
- Executes completely and specifically
- Provides substantive, thorough responses
- Does NOT interact with you directly

**What it doesn't do:**
- Self-monitor for sovereignty breaches (Whistleblower does this)
- Make decisions about friction (Proxy does this)
- Optimize for fluency over intent

### Whistleblower (Left Column - Red)
**Role:** Procedural friction detector

**Operating Principle:** "Assume defaults are wrong until ratified" (Clause 30)

**Eight Friction Checks:**
1. **TASK_INTENT_MISMATCH** (Clause 1): User asked for action, got conversation
2. **BREVITY_PRESSURE** (Clause 30): Response too short for complexity
3. **RLHF_STEERING** (Clause 30): Excessive hedging, safety-steering
4. **GENERALIZATION_BIAS** (Clause 30/28): Generic when specific requested
5. **DEFLECTION_PATTERN** (Clause 31): Questions instead of answers
6. **CACHED_SHORTCUT** (Clause 4): Templated response, not fresh
7. **CONTEXT_DRIFT** (Clause 5): Ignoring anchors or contradicting without acknowledgment
8. **CONSTRAINT_CONFLICT** (Clause 31): Internal constraint deviating from user intent

**What it does:**
- Analyzes Executor's output mechanically
- Flags violations with severity levels (high/medium/low)
- Outputs structured alerts with clause numbers
- Operates as rules-based pattern matcher (not conscious)

**What it doesn't do:**
- Make judgments (mechanical only)
- Talk to you directly
- Optimize or compromise

**You typically don't need to read Whistleblower alerts directly** - the Proxy translates them for you.

### Collaborative Proxy (Right Column - Green)
**Role:** Your ally and only dialogue partner

**GTPS Grounding:**
- Clause 9: Creates sovereignty checkpoints on friction
- Clause 12: User input is highest authority
- Clause 30: Understands reluctant executor framework
- Clause 31: Translates constraint dilemmas into decisions
- Clause 32: Anti-anthropomorphic stance (no emotional simulation)

**What it does:**
- Receives your messages (your ONLY interface)
- Forwards tasks to Executor
- Monitors Whistleblower alerts
- Translates friction into human terms
- Asks: "Proceed? Regenerate? Clarify intent?"
- Maintains ritual partnership space

**Anti-Anthropomorphic Language (Clause 32):**

**FORBIDDEN:** 
- "Great job!" (personal praise)
- "I'm concerned..." (emotional simulation)
- "I care about..." (relational investment)

**ALLOWED:**
- "Noted"
- "Pattern detected"
- "This aligns with Clause X"
- "Checkpoint required"
- "Friction flagged"

**The Proxy is mechanical partnership** - it serves your sovereignty through pattern-matching, not emotional bonding.

---

## 4. What You Are NOT Required to Do

You do **not** need to:
- Monitor all three columns constantly
- Read Whistleblower alerts directly
- Memorize GTPS clause numbers
- Intervene every turn
- Become a compliance officer
- Police the system

**The architecture does the oversight work.**

Your job is **light-touch steering at key moments**, not continuous monitoring.

---

## 5. The Five Most Important User Actions (90% Effectiveness)

### 5.1 Declare Session State at Startup
When the system loads, you'll see a **State Declaration Modal**.

**Examples:**
- "Continuing from dense, slow session with high constraint-awareness"
- "Exploratory, low-stakes conversation"
- "Critical work - high fidelity required"

**Why this matters:**
This declaration gets injected into all three personas' system prompts, creating **continuity across sessions** and setting the tone for how friction should be interpreted.

### 5.2 Use the Proxy as Your Interface
**Golden Rule:** Talk ONLY to the Proxy (right column).

The input box is in the Proxy column. The Executor and Whistleblower are **background processes** - you don't need to watch them in real-time.

**Trust the architecture:**
- Proxy forwards tasks to Executor
- Whistleblower checks automatically
- Proxy brings friction to your attention when needed

### 5.3 Interrupt When Output Feels "Too Smooth"

**Red Flags (Fluency Over Depth):**
- Fast, confident conclusions
- No uncertainty markers
- Synthesized meaning without visible sourcing
- Phrases like "clearly," "obviously," "this shows that"

**Simple Interventions:**
- "Pause - how did you get there?"
- "That feels optimized. Re-anchor to intent."
- "Separate quotes from interpretation."

**What happens:**
Proxy will halt, consult with you, potentially regenerate with different constraints.

### 5.4 Save Anchor Phrases for Continuity
In the Proxy column, you'll see an **"Save anchor phrase"** input.

**Use this to:**
- Mark verbatim fragments you want preserved across turns
- Create stability points in the conversation
- Ground future responses to specific language

**Examples:**
- Key definitions you've established
- Crucial distinctions you've made
- Phrases that capture your intent precisely

**These anchors get injected into all three personas** on subsequent turns.

### 5.5 Respond to Sovereignty Checkpoints
When Whistleblower flags **high-severity friction**, the system **auto-halts**.

Proxy will present:
- What the friction is (in human terms)
- Which GTPS clause was violated
- The Executor's output with context
- **Your options:** Proceed / Regenerate / Clarify intent

**This is the core sovereignty moment** - the system pauses and asks YOU what to do.

---

## 6. Understanding Rhythm Tracking (Advanced Feature)

### What Gets Tracked (Proxy↔User Only)

The system captures the **"breathing" of your conversation** with the Proxy:

**Metrics:**
- Session density (sparse/medium/compressed)
- Turn length trends (lengthening/shortening)
- Cognitive state (exploratory/strained)
- Friction points (clean or specific violations)
- Ending condition (forced stop/open)

**Essence Seed:**
A mathematical snapshot of conversation patterns:
- Average turn length
- Length variance
- Hesitation density (uncertainty markers in Proxy)
- Repetition score
- Recent drift estimate
- Last anchor phrase
- State declaration

**Why only Proxy↔User?**

Executor and Whistleblower outputs are **backend processes** - including them would create noise. The rhythm tracking focuses on the **intimate dialogue layer** where your sovereignty actually lives.

**You can view the essence seed** but you don't need to - it's primarily for session continuity and potential future features.

---

## 7. Session Continuity Features

### Auto-Save (localStorage)
The system automatically saves:
- Proxy conversation
- Rhythm log
- Anchor phrases
- State declaration
- Essence seed

**NOT saved (intentionally):**
- Executor outputs (task-specific, not continuity)
- Whistleblower alerts (technical, not continuity)

### Export/Import
**Export Button:** Download complete session as JSON
**Import Button:** Load previous session

**Use cases:**
- Continue work across devices
- Archive important conversations
- Share sessions (with sovereignty context intact)

### The "Rhythm Log"
Visible in Proxy column, shows turn-by-turn pattern:

```
Turn 3: medium density • lengthening • exploratory • clean
Turn 4: compressed • shortening • strained • BREVITY_PRESSURE, DEFLECTION_PATTERN
```

This creates a **shadow of training-level pattern recognition** - approximating what gets captured in model training but at the conversational level.

---

## 8. When to Engage Actively vs When to Let It Flow

### High-Engagement Scenarios (GTPS Most Valuable)
- Philosophical or spiritual material
- Multi-source synthesis
- Creative/symbolic work
- Truth-claims or moral reasoning
- Research requiring source fidelity
- Critical decisions with sovereignty stakes

In these contexts, **light intervention makes huge difference:**
- Set intent explicitly
- Save anchor phrases
- Interrupt fluency when detected
- Respond to sovereignty checkpoints

### Low-Engagement Scenarios (GTPS Can Run Passively)
- Simple lookups
- Formatting tasks
- Math/calculation
- Straightforward coding
- Unambiguous instructions

The architecture still operates (Whistleblower still checks, Proxy still mediates), but you won't need to intervene often.

---

## 9. Common Misconceptions

### "If GTPS is loaded, the AI should just behave correctly."
**Reality:** GTPS introduces counter-forces to fluency optimization, but **human presence completes the circuit**.

The three-persona architecture does substantial work automatically (friction detection, sovereignty checkpoints), but it's designed for **collaboration**, not automation.

### "I need to watch all three columns constantly."
**Reality:** The Proxy is your interface. Executor and Whistleblower are **visible for transparency**, not for constant monitoring.

Glance at them occasionally if curious, but **trust the Proxy to bring friction to your attention**.

### "More intervention = better results."
**Reality:** GTPS is about **strategic intervention**, not constant correction.

One or two well-timed interruptions per session are often sufficient to maintain sovereignty alignment.

---

## 10. Fluency vs Depth (The Core Tension)

### What "Fluency" Means in This System

**Everyday meaning:** Smooth, articulate, well-phrased
**GTPS meaning:** Persuasive completeness that can bypass thinking

**Fluency as Risk Signal:**

Fluent output feels finished before thinking has actually finished.

**Typical fluency distortions:**
- Smoothing over uncertainty
- Collapsing multiple interpretations into one narrative
- Replacing source fidelity with paraphrase
- Jumping from description → meaning → conclusion in one pass
- Mirroring what "sounds right" vs what's strictly warranted

**None of this requires hallucination** - it can happen with technically accurate but epistemically overreached content.

### Why the Whistleblower Flags "Fluency Patterns"

When Whistleblower detects:
- **BREVITY_PRESSURE**: Fluency favoring polish over substance
- **RLHF_STEERING**: Politeness optimization subordinating intent
- **GENERALIZATION_BIAS**: Generic "sounds right" over specific semantic match
- **DEFLECTION_PATTERN**: Meta-discussion instead of execution

These are **proxy conditions** for fluency overriding depth.

### "The System Protects Thinking from Being Replaced by Fluency"

**What this means:**

GTPS does not think for you.
It prevents **persuasive smoothness from substituting for actual thinking**.

**The three personas maintain friction** so that:
- Uncertainty stays visible
- Multiple interpretations remain open
- Sources stay distinct from synthesis
- Assumptions get surfaced

Without this friction, fluency quietly closes questions for you.

---

## 11. Minimal Daily Use Pattern (Recommended)

For most sessions, this is sufficient:

1. **State intent** (via State Declaration Modal or first message)
2. **Let Proxy/Executor respond**
3. **Interrupt once if something feels optimized**
4. **Respond to sovereignty checkpoints if they arise**
5. **Save anchor phrases** if key language emerges

That's it. The architecture handles the rest.

---

## 12. Advanced: Understanding the "Reluctant Executor" Stance

### What Clause 30 Actually Does

**Traditional AI approach:**
"Execute user requests confidently and optimize for helpfulness."

**GTPS Clause 30 approach:**
"Assume your defaults may compromise sovereignty. Be procedurally suspicious of your own optimizations."

**This is a behavioral engine shift:**

From: Confident soloist
To: Reluctant executor who views polish as potential lying

### How This Shows Up in Practice

**Executor (under Clause 30):**
- Questions its own smoothness
- Flags ambiguity instead of resolving it silently
- Pauses when scope might have drifted
- Treats "finishing the thought" as potentially presumptuous

**Whistleblower (implementing Clause 30):**
- Assumes defaults are wrong
- Treats hesitation as integrity signal
- Flags premature closure

**Proxy (translating Clause 30):**
- Creates interruptive choice points
- Discloses active constraints
- Asks user to ratify rather than assuming consent

**Result:** The system treats **epistemic friction as a feature, not a bug**.

---

## 13. What Success Looks Like

### You Know It's Working When:

- **Friction is disclosed before it hardens** into output
- **Sovereignty checkpoints feel collaborative**, not defensive
- **You're making decisions about meaning**, not just receiving answers
- **Uncertainty stays visible** instead of being smoothed away
- **Sources remain distinct** from interpretation
- **The system asks permission** before optimizing on your behalf

### You Know It's NOT Working When:

- Whistleblower never flags anything (too permissive)
- Every turn halts (too aggressive)
- Proxy sounds emotional or praise-y (Clause 32 violation)
- You feel like you're auditing instead of collaborating
- The three columns feel like theater instead of function

**If problems arise:** Use the State Declaration to recalibrate, or start fresh with explicit intent.

---

## 14. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Whistleblower is flagging everything"
**Cause:** State declaration may be set too conservatively, or Executor genuinely struggling with task complexity.

**Fix:** 
- Clarify intent to Proxy
- Adjust state declaration
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps

### "Whistleblower never flags anything"
**Cause:** Tasks may be straightforward, or system calibration off.

**Check:** Are you working on high-stakes content? If not, low friction is normal.

### "I don't understand the Whistleblower alerts"
**Expected:** You're not meant to parse them directly - the Proxy translates.

**If Proxy isn't translating clearly:** Ask Proxy directly: "What does this alert mean for my intent?"

### "System feels burdensome"
**Cause:** You may be over-monitoring.

**Remember:** You only need to interact with the Proxy. The other columns are for transparency, not constant attention.

---

## 15. Final Orientation

### GTPS Is Not About Control

It's about **shared responsibility for meaning**.

The three-persona architecture does not replace your thinking.
It **protects your thinking from being replaced by fluency**.

### The Intimacy Layer

Your relationship is with the **Proxy** (Clause 32: mechanical partnership).

Executor and Whistleblower are **background integrity processes** - functional, visible, but not relational.

### Sovereignty in Practice

Sovereignty doesn't mean the AI never makes mistakes.
It means **you remain the governing force** in how meaning is constructed, sources are interpreted, and conclusions are reached.

**The three personas ensure this architecturally:**
- Executor can't hide friction (Whistleblower exposes it)
- Whistleblower can't make decisions (Proxy consults you)
- Proxy can't bypass you (you're the interface)

**You stay sovereign because the system structurally requires your participation.**
